TestGameEngine
==============
This is a test engine for a game I'm creating. It is to be an RTS game, the same genre as Age of Empires and Starcraft. 
However, there's plenty of differences. For instance, you're world is centered around your general. Outside of a certain radius around him, you can't see anything, or control anyone. Permanent fog of war. However, scouts can be told to report back information that they find.
There are still plenty of features to add, and its happening slowly but surely. Graphics on the other hand, are desperately needed and not happening at all, as I have no graphical talent whatsoever.

Currently, the project is being ported to openGL, because I want the cross-platform compatability.
